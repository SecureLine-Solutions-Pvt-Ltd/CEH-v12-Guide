## Data Loss Prevention
Data loss prevention (DLP) software detects potential data breaches/data ex-filtration transmissions and prevents them by monitoring, detecting and blocking sensitive data while in use (endpoint actions), in motion (network traffic), and at rest (data storage).

## Database Connection
A database connection is a facility in computer science that allows client software to talk to database server software, whether on the same machine or not.
A connection is required to send commands and receive answers, usually in the form of a result set.

## Default Credentials
A Default Credential vulnerability is a type of vulnerability in a computing device that most commonly affects devices having some pre-set (default) administrative credentials to access all configuration settings.
The vendor or manufacturer of such devices uses a single pre-defined set of admin credentials to access the device configurations, and any potential hacker can misuse this fact to hack such devices, if those credentials are not changed by consumers.

## Defense in Depth
Defense in depth is a concept used in information security in which multiple layers of security controls (defense) are placed throughout an information technology (IT) system.
Its intent is to provide redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited that can cover aspects of personnel, procedural, technical and physical security for the duration of the system's life cycle.

## Demilitarized Zone
In computer security, a DMZ or demilitarized zone (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network or screened subnet) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted, usually larger, network such as the Internet.

## Denial of Service Attack
In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

## Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
The diamond model of intrusion analysis is a model used by information security professionals to authenticate and track cyber threats.
It contains 4 parts - adversary, infrastructure, capability, and target.
It gives analysts a comprehensive view of cyber attacks.

## Dictionary Attack
In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is an attack using a restricted subset of a keyspace to defeat a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase, sometimes trying thousands or millions of likely possibilities often obtained from lists of past security breaches.

## Dig
Extensive web interface to dig for doing online dns lookup / nameserver query.

## Digicert
DigiCert, Inc. is an American digital security company headquartered in Lehi, Utah, with offices in Australia, Ireland, Japan, India, France,South Africa, Switzerland and United Kingdom.
As a certificate authority (CA) and trusted third party, DigiCert provides the public key infrastructure (PKI) and validation required for issuing digital certificates or TLS/SSL certificates.

## Digital Millennium Copyright Act
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a 1998 United States copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM).

## Digital Signature
A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.
A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very high confidence that the message was created by a known sender (authenticity), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).

## Directory Traversal
A directory traversal (or path traversal) attack exploits insufficient security validation or sanitization of user-supplied file names, such that characters representing "traverse to parent directory" are passed through to the operating system's file system API.
An affected application can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the file system.

## Disassociation Attack
A Wi-Fi deauthentication attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that targets communication between a user and a Wi-Fi wireless access point.

## Distributed Control System
A distributed control system (DCS) is a computerised control system for a process or plant usually with many control loops, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is no central operator supervisory control.
This is in contrast to systems that use centralized controllers; either discrete controllers located at a central control room or within a central computer.

## Distributed Denial of Service Attack
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers.
A DDoS attack uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware.

## Domain Name System
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and distributed naming system used to identify computers reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

## Domain Name System Amplification
DNS amplification is a DDoS attack that leverages DNS resolvers to overwhelm a victim with traffic.

## Domain Name System Hijacking
DNS hijacking, DNS poisoning, or DNS redirection is the practice of subverting the resolution of Domain Name System (DNS) queries.
This can be achieved by malware that overrides a computer's TCP/IP configuration to point at a rogue DNS server under the control of an attacker, or through modifying the behaviour of a trusted DNS server so that it does not comply with internet standards.

## Domain Name System Security Extensions
The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of extension specifications by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for securing data exchanged in the Domain Name System (DNS) in Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

## Domain Name System Spoofing
DNS spoofing, also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address.
This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).

## Domain Name System Zone Transfer
DNS zone transfer, also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a type of DNS transaction.
It is one of the many mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers.

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client–server architecture.

### Rogue DHCP server
A rogue DHCP server is a DHCP server on a network which is not under the administrative control of the network staff.
It is a network device such as a modem or a router connected to the network by a user who may be either unaware of the consequences of their actions or may be knowingly using it for network attacks such as man in the middle.
