# Definitions C

## Certificate Authority
In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that stores, signs, and issues digital certificates.
A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate.
This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key.

## CIA Triad
Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity.

### Confidentiality
Involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through confidentiality agreements that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.

### Integrity
Means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.

### Availability
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.

## Cipher
In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.

### Substitution cipher
In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced with the ciphertext, in a defined manner, with the help of a key; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution process to extract the original message.

An example of a substitution cipher is the Caesar cipher.

### Transposition cipher
In cryptography, a transposition cipher is a method of encryption which scrambles the positions of characters (transposition) without changing the characters themselves.

### Block cipher
In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks. They are specified elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols and are widely used to encrypt large amounts of data, including in data exchange protocols. It uses blocks as an unvarying transformation.

### Stream cipher
A stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream).

## Cipher Block Chaining
Ehrsam, Meyer, Smith and Tuchman invented the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of operation in 1976.
In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted.
This way, each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point.

## Clickjacking
Clickjacking (classified as a user interface redress attack or UI redressing) is a malicious technique of tricking a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, thus potentially revealing confidential information or allowing others to take control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous objects, including web pages.

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.

### Public cloud 
Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.

### Private cloud
Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.

### Hybrid cloud
Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources,[100][101] that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.

### Community cloud
Community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party, and either hosted internally or externally.

### Infrastructure as a service
"Infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc.

### Platform as a service
The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.

### Software as a service
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure.

## Code Review
Code review (sometimes referred to as peer review) is a software quality assurance activity in which one or several people check a program mainly by viewing and reading parts of its source code, and they do so after implementation or as an interruption of implementation.

## Credential Stuffing
Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack in which the attacker collects stolen account credentials, typically consisting of lists of usernames and/or email addresses and the corresponding passwords (often from a data breach), and then uses the credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on other systems through large-scale automated login requests directed against a web application.

## Cross Origin Resource Sharing
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

## Cryptanalysis
Cryptanalysis (from the Greek kryptós, "hidden", and analýein, "to analyze") refers to the process of analyzing information systems in order to understand hidden aspects of the systems.
Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.

### Linear cryptanalysis
In cryptography, linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher.
Attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers.
Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis.

### Differential cryptanalysis
Differential cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions.
In the broadest sense, it is the study of how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output.

### Integral cryptanalysis
In cryptography, integral cryptanalysis is a cryptanalytic attack that is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on substitution–permutation networks.
It was originally designed by Lars Knudsen as a dedicated attack against Square, so it is commonly known as the Square attack.

## Cryptography
Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "to write", or -λογία -logia, "study", respectively), is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.

### Elliptic-curve cryptography
Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.
ECC allows smaller keys compared to non-EC cryptography (based on plain Galois fields) to provide equivalent security.

### Quantum cryptography
Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks.
The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which offers an information-theoretically secure solution to the key exchange problem.
