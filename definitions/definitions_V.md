## Virus
A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code.

### Polymorphic Virus
A polymorphic virus is a harmful, destructive or intrusive type of malware that can change or "morph," making it difficult to detect with antimalware programs.

### Metamorphic Virus
Metamorphic code is code that when run outputs a logically equivalent version of its own code under some interpretation. This is similar to a quine, except that a quine's source code is exactly equivalent to its own output. Metamorphic code also usually outputs machine code and not its own source code.

### Macro Virus
In computing terminology, a macro virus is a virus that is written in a macro language: a programming language which is embedded inside a software application (e.g., word processors and spreadsheet applications).

### Boot Sector Virus
A boot sector virus is a type of malware that infects a system's boot partition or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a hard disk.
During startup and before security software can be executed, the virus executes malicious code.

## Virtual Hosting
Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names (with separate handling of each name) on a single server (or pool of servers).
This allows one server to share its resources, such as memory and processor cycles, without requiring all services provided to use the same host name.

## Virus Hoax
A computer virus hoax is a message warning the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat.
The message is usually a chain e-mail that tells the recipients to forward it to everyone they know, but it can also be in the form of a pop-up window.

## Virtual Machine
In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system.
Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer.

## Virtual Private Network
A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.

## VLAN Hopping
VLAN hopping is a computer security exploit, a method of attacking networked resources on a virtual LAN (VLAN).
The basic concept behind all VLAN hopping attacks is for an attacking host on a VLAN to gain access to traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible.

## Vulnerability
Vulnerabilities are flaws in a computer system that weaken the overall security of the device/system.
Vulnerabilities can be weaknesses in either the hardware itself, or the software that runs on the hardware.

## Vulnerability Assessment
A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system.
Examples of systems for which vulnerability assessments are performed include, but are not limited to, information technology systems, energy supply systems, water supply systems, transportation systems, and communication systems.

## Vulnerability Scanner
A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesses.
These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system.
They are utilized in the identification and detection of vulnerabilities arising from mis-configurations or flawed programming within a network-based asset such as a firewall, router, web server, application server, etc.
