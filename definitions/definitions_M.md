## Machine Learning
> Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.

## Malware
Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.

## Malware Analysis
Malware analysis is the study or process of determining the functionality, origin and potential impact of a given malware sample such as a virus, worm, trojan horse, rootkit, or backdoor.
 
### Static malware analysis
Static malware analysis: Static or Code Analysis is usually performed by dissecting the different resources of the binary file without executing it and studying each component.
The binary file can also be disassembled (or reverse engineered) using a disassembler such as IDA or Ghidra.

### Dynamic malware analysis
Dynamic malware analysis: Dynamic or Behavioral analysis is performed by observing the behavior of the malware while it is actually running on a host system.
This form of analysis is often performed in a sandbox environment to prevent the malware from actually infecting production systems; many such sandboxes are virtual systems that can easily be rolled back to a clean state after the analysis is complete.

## Man in the Middle Attack
In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle, monster-in-the-middle, machine-in-the-middle, monkey-in-the-middle, meddler-in-the-middle, manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM), person-in-the-middle (PITM) or adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attack is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the attacker has inserted themselves between the two parties.

## Masquerading
A masquerade attack is an online attack in which the attacker masquerades as a legitimate user to gain access to a device.

## Media Access Control Address
A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.
Within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer.

## Media Access Control Address Flooding
In computer networking, a media access control attack or MAC flooding is a technique employed to compromise the security of network switches.

## Media Access Control Address Spoofing
MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device.
The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed.
However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed.

## Meet in the Middle Attack
The meet-in-the-middle attack (MITM), a known plaintext attack, is a generic space–time tradeoff cryptographic attack against encryption schemes that rely on performing multiple encryption operations in sequence.
The MITM attack is the primary reason why Double DES is not used and why a Triple DES key (168-bit) can be brute-forced by an attacker with 256 space and 2112 operations.

## Memory Leak
In computer science, a memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations[1] in a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released. A memory leak may also happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code (i.e. unreachable memory).[2] A memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code.

## Message Authentication Code
In cryptography, a message authentication code (MAC), sometimes known as a tag, is a short piece of information used for authenticating a message.
In other words, to confirm that the message came from the stated sender (its authenticity) and has not been changed.
The MAC value protects a message's data integrity, as well as its authenticity, by allowing verifiers (who also possess the secret key) to detect any changes to the message content.

## Metasearch Engine
A metasearch engine (or search aggregator) is an online information retrieval tool that uses the data of a web search engine to produce its own results.

## Metasploit
Knowledge is power, especially when it’s shared.
A collaboration between the open source community and Rapid7, Metasploit helps security teams do more than just verify vulnerabilities, manage security assessments, and improve security awareness; it empowers and arms defenders to always stay one step (or two) ahead of the game.

## Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure, often referred to as Azure, is a cloud computing platform operated by Microsoft for application management via Microsoft-managed data centers.

### Azure Function
Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs.

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

## Mobile Device Management
Mobile device management (MDM) is the administration of mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, and laptops.
MDM is usually implemented with the use of a third-party product that has management features for particular vendors of mobile devices.

### Personally Owned, Corporate Enabled
A personally owned device is any technology device that was purchased by an individual and was not issued by the agency. A personal device includes any portable technology such as cameras, USB flash drives, mobile wireless devices, tablets, laptops or personal desktop computers.

### Coorperate Owned, Personally Enabled
As part of enterprise mobility, an alternative approach are corporate-owned, personally enabled devices (COPE). Under such policies, the company purchases and provides devices to their employees, but the functionality of a private device is enabled to allow personal usage.

## Multi Factor Authentication
Multi-factor authentication (MFA; encompassing two-factor authentication, or 2FA, along with similar terms) is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user has), and inherence (something only the user is).
