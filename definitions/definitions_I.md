# Definitions I

## Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs when someone uses another person's personal identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes.
The term identity theft was coined in 1964.

### Identity theft - child identity theft
Child identity theft occurs when a minor's identity is used by another person for the impostor's personal gain. 

### Identity theft - criminal identity theft
When a criminal fraudulently identifies themselves to police as another individual at the point of arrest, it is sometimes referred to as "Criminal Identity Theft."

### Identity theft - financial identity theft
The most common type of identity theft is related to finance.
Financial identity theft includes obtaining credit, loans, goods, and services while claiming to be someone else.

### Identity theft - synthetic identity theft
A variation of identity theft that has recently become more common is synthetic identity theft, in which identities are completely or partially fabricated

## Incident Management
An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions.
Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence.

## Incident Response Team
An incident response team (IRT) or emergency response team (ERT) is a group of people who prepare for and respond to an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an interruption of business operations.
Incident response teams are common in public service organizations as well as in other organizations, either military or specialty.
This team is generally composed of specific members designated before an incident occurs, although under certain circumstances the team may be an ad hoc group of willing volunteers.

## Indicator of Compromise
Indicator of compromise (IoC) in computer forensics is an artifact observed on a network or in an operating system that, with high confidence, indicates a computer intrusion.
Typical IoCs are virus signatures and IP addresses, MD5 hashes of malware files, or URLs or domain names of botnet command and control servers.
After IoCs have been identified via a process of incident response and computer forensics, they can be used for early detection of future attack attempts using intrusion detection systems and antivirus software.

## Industrial Control System
An industrial control system (ICS) is an electronic control system and associated instrumentation used for industrial process control.
Control systems can range in size from a few modular panel-mounted controllers to large interconnected and interactive distributed control systems (DCSs) with many thousands of field connections.

## Information Assurance
Information assurance (IA) is the practice of assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information.
Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of user data.

## Information Security
Information security, sometimes shortened to InfoSec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks.

## Information Security Risk
The risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation due to the potential for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and/or information systems.

## Information Warfare
Information warfare (IW) (as different from cyber warfare that attacks computers, software, and command control systems) is a concept involving the battlespace use and management of information and communication technology (ICT) in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent.
Examples:
- Command and control warfare
- Electronic warfare
- Hacker warfare

## Insecure Direct Object Reference
Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) is a type of access control vulnerability in digital security.

## Insider
An employee that is already inside of the organization.

## Insider Threat
Insider threat
An insider threat is a malicious threat to an organization that comes from people within the organization, such as employees, former employees, contractors or business associates, who have inside information concerning the organization's security practices, data and computer systems.
The threat may involve fraud, the theft of confidential or commercially valuable information, the theft of intellectual property, or the sabotage of computer systems.

- Malicious insiders: People who take advantage of their access to inflict harm on an organization.
- Negligent insiders: People who make errors and disregard policies, which place their organizations at risk.
- Infiltrators: People who are external actors that obtain legitimate access credentials without authorization.

## Internet Information Services
Internet Information Services (IIS, formerly Internet Information Server) is an extensible web server software created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.

## Internet of Things
The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.

## Internet Protocol Address Spoofing
In computer networking, IP address spoofing or IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.

## Internet Protocol Fragmentation
IP fragmentation is an Internet Protocol (IP) process that breaks packets into smaller pieces (fragments), so that the resulting pieces can pass through a link with a smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) than the original packet size.
The fragments are reassembled by the receiving host.

## Internet Protocol Fragmentation Attack
IP fragmentation attacks are a kind of computer security attack based on how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires data to be transmitted and processed.
Specifically, it invokes IP fragmentation, a process used to partition messages (the service data unit (SDU); typically a packet) from one layer of a network into multiple smaller payloads that can fit within the lower layer's protocol data unit (PDU).

## Internet Protocol Security
In computing, Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network. It is used in virtual private networks (VPNs).

### Authentication header
The Security Authentication Header (AH) was developed at the US Naval Research Laboratory in the early 1990s and is derived in part from previous IETF standards' work for authentication of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version 2.
Authentication Header (AH) is a member of the IPsec protocol suite.
AH ensures connectionless integrity by using a hash function and a secret shared key in the AH algorithm.
AH also guarantees the data origin by authenticating IP packets.

### Encapsulation security payload (ESP)
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is a member of the IPsec protocol suite.
It provides origin authenticity through source authentication, data integrity through hash functions and confidentiality through encryption protection for IP packets.

## Internet Relay Chat
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based chat system for instant messaging.
IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.

## Intrusion Detection System
An intrusion detection system (IDS; also intrusion prevention system or IPS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.

## IOS Jailbreaking
On Apple devices running iOS and iOS-based operating systems, jailbreaking is the use of a privilege escalation exploit to remove software restrictions imposed by the manufacturer.
Typically it is done through a series of kernel patches.

## ISO 27001
ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard on how to manage information security.
The standard was originally published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2005 and then revised in 2013.
It details requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS) – the aim of which is to help organizations make the information assets they hold more secure.
